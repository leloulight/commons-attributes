= Release Notes for Commons-Attributes =

== 2.2 ==

 + Added getCause() to applicable Throwables, making them compliant 
   with the standard Java2 1.4 nested throwable spec.

== 2.1 ==

 + Made the Maven plugin only run the attribute compiler if
   a project property named org.apache.commons.attributes.enabled
   was set to 'true'. Likewise, the attribute indexer will only run if
   a project property named org.apache.commons.attributes.index.enabled
   is set to 'true'. This to keep these two tasks to be run on
   every single project being built.

   If your project uses C-A, you should add the following lines
   to your project.properties:

      ################################################################
      # Commons-Attributes
      ################################################################
      org.apache.commons.attributes.enable=true
      org.apache.commons.attributes.index.enable=true

 + Fixed bug where a method whose parameters included an inner class
   could not have attributes added to it:

      public class Outer {
          public static class Inner {}

          /**
           * @@SomeAttribute()
           */
          public void method (Inner inner) {}
      }

      ...

      Method method = 
          Outer.class.getMethod(
              "method", 
              new Class[]{ Outer.Inner.class });

      Collection methodAttributes = 
          Attributes.getAttributes (method);

      // Prints 0, not 1
      System.out.println (methodAttributes.size ()); 

== 2.0alpha ==

Unofficial "release" that (perhaps unfortunately) saw widespread
use.
