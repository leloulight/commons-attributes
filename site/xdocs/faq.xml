            <p><b>Q: How does Commons-Attributes fit in with the annotations in Java 1.5?</b></p>
            
            <p>
                <b>A:</b> With annotations we'll finally have a standard API for metadata in Java. The downside
                is that we have to switch to Java 1.5. Since people even now are still stuck with 
                Java 1.2 and Java 1.3, it may be a while before a project can require 1.5 and still 
                have a reasonably-sized audience and/or usefulness.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                This is where Commons-Attributes comes in.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Ultimately this s a choice you must make based on your own preconditions, but this
                is my advice: You should switch to 1.5 if you can, given stability, compatibility 
                et cetera. After all, it is the standard that people will use when it becomes the standard
                (which it will). However, if you foresee that you'll stick with 1.4 or earlier and you 
                think that metadata is the most cost-effective way of solving your problem, then
                you should definitely take a closer look at Commons-Attributes.

                <b>A:</b> A number of companies use C-A in their products, and I have myself used in 
                deployed business-critical systems. Less anonymous users are:
