            <p><b>Q: How does Commons-Attributes fit in with the annotations in Java 1.5?</b></p>
            
            <p>
                <b>A:</b> With annotations we'll finally have a standard API for metadata in Java. The downside
                is that we have to switch to Java 1.5. Since people even now are still stuck with 
                Java 1.2 and Java 1.3, it may be a while before a project can require 1.5 and still 
                have a reasonably-sized audience and/or usefulness.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                This is where Commons-Attributes comes in.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Ultimately this s a choice you must make based on your own preconditions, but this
                is my advice: You should switch to 1.5 if you can, given stability, compatibility 
                et cetera. After all, it is the standard that people will use when it becomes the standard
                (which it will). However, if you foresee that you'll stick with 1.4 or earlier and you 
                think that metadata is the most cost-effective way of solving your problem, then
                you should definitely take a closer look at Commons-Attributes.

            <p>
                <b>A:</b> A number of companies use C-A in their products, and I have myself used in 
                deployed business-critical systems. Less anonymous users are:

        <section name="Other Frameworks">
            
            <p><b>Q: How does Commons-Attributes compare to  other metadata frameworks, such as 
                    JSR175, MetaClass, qDox, JAM, etc?</b></p>
            
            <p><b>A:</b> This is a two-part answer. First JSR175: When Java 5.0 becomes as commonly 
                used as 1.3+1.4 is today, nobody will want to use any other metadata framework, just 
                like nobody wants to use any other string class than the java.lang one. Therefore, by 
                that time, C-A will have been rendered superfluous, and development will stop.</p>
            
            <p>Compared to JAM, QDox, etc. C-A stands up very well. It offers a simple API, powerful 
                annotation features, type-safety and low overhead. Let's examine these points:</p>
            
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>Simple API: Too many frameworks try to be the all-encompassing &#xfc;ber-framework - 
                        and usually fails at that. The result is an over-complicated API, that still 
                        won't let you do what you want to do. C-A aims to do one thing, and do it well.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Powerful annotation features: You can attach attributes to classes, methods, 
                        fields, method parameters and return values. You can also control how an 
                        attribute can be used via the <a href="api/org/apache/commons/attributes/Target.html"><tt>Target</tt></a>
                        meta-attribute. Few other frameworks offer all these features.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Type safety: Most other frameworks are limited to key-value pairs of Strings. 
                        C-A lets you use JavaBeans, which gives you a layer of compile-time safety 
                        against mistyping an attribute name.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Low overhead: C-A has no runtime dependencies, and fits into a 36k jar file.</p>
                </li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>In summary, C-A stands up very well.</p>
