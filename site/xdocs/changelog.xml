                    <p>
                        Fixed bug in compiler that made it impossible to add
                        attributes to a method that took a parameter whose type 
                        was an inner class.

                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        Bumped version number to 2.1.

            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        Added a Taglet for Javadoc 1.4 and later.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        Added a the attribute-validator task.
                    </p>

        <section name="2004-03-21">
            
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        Fixed bug where attributes would be inherited from
                        private methods. Since the methods themselves aren't
                        inherited, the attributes shouldn't be either.
                    </p>
                </li>
            </ul>

        <section name="2004-03-19">
            
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        Changed the way AttributeIndexes are implemented. Previously,
                        any attributes that were both Indexed and Inheritable would
                        not work as expected - the index would not find the class that
                        had inherited the indexed attribute, only the class declaring it.
                    </p>
