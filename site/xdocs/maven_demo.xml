            <p>
                This is a quick demo that shows how to use attributes together with 
                Maven. Don't worry about 90% here seemingly being pure unexplainable
                magic - the purpose of this part of the tutorial is to show you
                what steps you must do to make the Commons Attributes package work.
                In the walkthrough we'll focus more on just what happens, and how
                the all features work.
